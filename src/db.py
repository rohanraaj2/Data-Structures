        The index is initialized with an empty skiplist.

        Parameters:

        '''Construct an index using values of the specified attribute.

        attribute must be one of the column headers from the CSV file from which
        the records were read. all values for attribute must be unique.

        Any existing index is lost and a new one is constructed. The constructed
        index is empty if no records are currently stored.

        The index stores (key, value) pairs where the keys are the values of
        attribute. The value is the location, e.g. index, of the corresponding
        record. Note that the value is not the record itself.

        Parameters:
        - self: mandatory reference to this object
        - attribute: the attribute whose values are to be the keys in the index

        The index is used to find the record. An error occurs if the index is
        not yet created or the key in invalid. This is indicated by a return of
        None.

        Parameters:
        - self: mandatory reference to this object
        - key: the key whose corresponding value is sought

        Returns:
        The record corresponding to key, None in case of error.

        [start,end] inclusive, None in case of error.

        An error occurs if no index has been created, start or end is not a valid
        key in the index, or start is not less than end.

        Parameters:
        - self: mandatory reference to this object
        - start: the starting key value in the range of keys

        An error occurs if no index has been created, or key does not exist in
        it.

        Parameters:
        - self: mandatory reference to this object
